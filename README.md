Essentially the plan is the create neural nets for some simple tasks, and overtime create them with less powerful tech. I will begin with MNIST, simple games, and use pytorch, then numpy, then raw python, and then well we will see, can theoretically keep going further.

The essential aim is to understand top to bottom, electron to software stack, how deep learning works, to expand personal beliefs, build skills, do a challenge.
