Essentially the plan is the create neural nets for some simple tasks, and overtime create them with less powerful tech. I will begin with MNIST, simple games, and use pytorch, then numpy, then raw python, and then well we will see, can theoretically keep going far.

Anyway the goal is to learn, expand personal beliefs, build skills, do a challenge.
